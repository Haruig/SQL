#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <>'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iphone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT distinct Product,price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?SELECT
count(distinct cust.acctnum),
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales FEB
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON FEB.orderid=cust.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <>'Order ID';
